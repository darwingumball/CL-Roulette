# CL-Roulette
Command Line Roulette by Evan S

Input # of players, type Color and Parity choices before betting process, bet on your choices or skip, 
generated Roulette result will decide weather yours bets win or lose and return each players final balance.

If you want to make this a continous loop that saves player money instead of starting over and asking how many players again with new balances:

Create a loop that starts right before int randomNumber; is initialized in main.cpp,
end it at the bottom of the main function, but right before the end ask players if they want to play again (yes or no), if yes continue loop if no break and exit.

The goal of this project was to test my OOP structure and logic skills. C++
